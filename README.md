# STACK
This is a stack library and its supporting functions.
This repository contains implementation of stack data structure and its corresponding functions.
1. Stackusing array
          1. This is implemented using arrays.This has two constructors.
               a) First one which does not take any parameter and initializes size to 10.
               b) Second one takes size of the stack from the user
          2. Functions
               a) push(data)
               b) pop()
               c) isempty()-returns boolean value whether stack is empty or not.
               d) isfull()-returns boolean value whether stack is full or not
               e) currentsize()-return the current size of stack.
 
 
 
 2. Stack
           1. This is implemented using linkedlist.
           2. Functions
                a) push()
                b) pop()
                c) isempty()-returns boolean value whether stack is empty or not.
                d) returntotal()-returns the current size of stack.
                e) returntop()-returns the value of top element in stack.
 3. Special Stack
          This is the special stack which supports returning min element(present in stack at any time) in O(1).
 
 
 
 4. Balanced Parenthesis
    This is the function which returns boolean value based on whether the all parenthesis in string are balanced or not.
